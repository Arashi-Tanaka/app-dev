##**My favorite series/movies**
1. *Leroy and Stitch*
  > This is by far my favorite, especially when Leroy and Stitch fought inside a stadium with their clones and cousins. and I can't forget that it ended with a huge concert to stop Leroy.
2. *First Pokemon Movie*
  > This movie made me cry, especially when Ash turned into stone and Pikachu and the other normal and cloned Pokemon started crying, it ended well though with Ash depetrifying and MewTwo learning something in the end.
3. *Spirited Away*
  > The whole movie is just magical, especially when there are fight or chase scenes, but what I like about it most is the characters with Chihiro becoming more mature and Kohaku remembering his name again, and can't forget about No face and Granny, both of them are shown as corrupt butt also can become kind.
